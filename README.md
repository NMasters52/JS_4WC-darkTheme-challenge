# Lunch Break Coding Challenge: Dynamic Styling (Week 1, Thursday)

This project is part of a personal 4-week coding challenge I've undertaken during my lunch breaks. I'm aiming to improve my front-end development skills by tackling a small project each day, using only my iPad and GitHub Codespaces.

**Week 2 Theme: Foundations**

* **Thursday: Dynamic Styling**
    * Task: Build a theme switcher (light/dark mode toggle).
    * Example: A button that changes the background color of the page.

## Project Description

This project implements a simple light/dark mode theme switcher. A button on the page allows users to toggle between a light and dark theme. The theme is applied dynamically using JavaScript and CSS, leveraging the `data-theme` attribute for styling.

## Technologies Used

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript

## How to Use

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [repository URL]
    ```
2.  **Open `index.html`:** Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
3.  **Toggle Theme:** Click the "Switch to Dark Mode" or "Switch to Light Mode" button to change the theme.

## Implementation Details

* JavaScript dynamically adds or removes the `data-theme="dark"` attribute to the `<html>` element.
* CSS uses attribute selectors (`[data-theme="dark"]`) to apply different styles based on the active theme.
* The button text content is changed dynamically to reflect the current theme.

## Challenges

* Coding on an iPad using Codespaces presented some unique challenges, but it proved to be a productive environment.
* Fitting the coding into a short lunch break required efficient planning and execution.

## Future Improvements

* Implement persistent theme preferences (e.g., using local storage).
* Improve accessibility by ensuring sufficient color contrast and adding ARIA attributes.
* Add more styling elements.
